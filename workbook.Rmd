Create a vector named years that contains all year numbers from 2017 to the current year by listing the individual years.

On the next line, use print() to output years.
```{r}
# create vector called years:
years = c(2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
print(years)
```
Create another vector named years2 that contains all year numbers from 2017 to the current year by using one of the shortcuts above for consecutive numbers.

On the next line, use print() to output years2
```{r}
# create vector called years2:
years2 = c(2017:2024)
print(years2)
```

The vector top_movies_2019 contains the top ten grossing movies from 2019, in order of their rank so that the top movie is at the beginning of the vector. Create a variable top_six_movies that stores the 6th highest-grossing movie from the vector. On the next line, print top_six_movies.

Create a variable top_three_movies that stores the top 3 movies from top_movies_2019, accessing the elements with an index vector.

On the next line, print top_three_movies.
```{r}
top_movies_2019 = c(
  "Avengers: Endgame",
  "The Lion King",
  "Toy Story 4",
  "Frozen 2",
  "Captain Marvel",
  "Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker",
  "Spider-Man: Far from Home",
  "Aladdin",
  "Joker",
  "It Chapter Two"
)

# create variable top_six_movies:
top_six_movies = top_movies_2019[6]
print(top_six_movies)

# create vector called top_three_movies:
top_three_movies <- top_movies_2019[c(1:3)]
print(top_three_movies)
```

Correct the typo in the existing vector vegetables so that the third element says "spinach" instead.

Then, print vegetables on the next line.
```{r}
vegetables <- c("celery", "squash", "spinch", "kale", "radish", "carrot", "onion")
# correct to spinach here:
vegetables[vegetables == 'spinch'] <- "spinach"
print(vegetables)

```
See the vector scores. You’re a generous teacher and want to round some really low scores up. Modify the vector so that every score below 60 is set to 60.

Print scores after.
```{r}
scores <- c(44, 65, 77, 49, 56, 75, 59, 90, 72)
#modify scores below:
scores[scores < 60] <- 60
print(scores)
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a matrix called one_hundred_greetings that has 10 rows and 10 columns full of "hi"s
```{r}
# create one_hundred_greetings matrix below:
one_hundred_greetings <- matrix("hi", nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
print(one_hundred_greetings)
```
Create a number matrix called different_neighbors in R based on what’s shown below: A 3 row by 5 column matrix where the first column is [0 1], second column is [1 0], and it alternates in this pattern
You can print different_neighbors to make sure it looks right.
```{r}
# create different_neighbors matrix below:
different_neighbors <- matrix(c(1,0),nrow=3,ncol=5)
print(different_neighbors)

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the matrix defined as twenty_eight_matrix. Get the element in the 2nd row, 4th column and store it in a variable called middle_element.

Then print middle_element.

Get the 6th column of the matrix and store it in a variable called sixth_column.

Then print sixth_column.
```{r}
twenty_eight_matrix <- matrix(c(1:28), nrow = 4, ncol = 7)
print(twenty_eight_matrix)

# get the element in second row, 4th column
middle_element <- twenty_eight_matrix[2,4]
print(middle_element)

sixth_column <- twenty_eight_matrix[,6]
print(sixth_column)
```

Create a list called fruit_basket that contains, in this order:

  Your favorite fruit in a string
  The number of kilograms of the fruit you want to buy e.g. 3.5
  A vector of at least two friends’ names to gift the fruits to

Hmm. Seems like you have just enough cash to get 10 kg. Modify the second element of the list, where you’ve stored how many kg’s you’ll buy, to 10.
Then print fruit_basket.
```{r}
# create list fruit_basket below:
fruit_basket <- list("melon", 5.0, c("Andrew","Mike"))
fruit_basket[[2]] <- 10.0

print(fruit_basket)
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See the test_scores list created.

Create a variable nick_scores that stores Nick’s scores for all the exams. Print nick_scores.

Create another variable nick_exam2 that stores Nick’s score for exam 2. Print nick_exam2.
```{r}
test_scores <- list(
  Penny = list(exam1 = 84, exam2 = 79, exam3 = 85),
  Nick = list(exam1= 77, exam2 = 81, exam3 = 83),
  Kiara = list(exam1 = 92, exam2 = 89, exam3 = 87)
)
# create variable nick_scores
nick_scores <- test_scores$Nick
nick_exam2 <- test_scores$Nick$exam2
print(nick_exam2)

```

First, there should be a check on whether age is 21+ or 18+.

  If age is 21 or above, set access_event to TRUE and print "I got in for the night!". If 21+, you can also check whether you have the right codeword to access the secret music show at 11. If your possible_codeword matches the real_codeword using the == comparison operator, set access_music_show to TRUE and print "I need to get a good spot!". Hint: this codeword check should be a nested conditional.

  But if age is 18+ but not 21+, you have to check whether the current_hour is earlier than 11. If it is, you can set access_event to TRUE and you should print "I can stay until 11!“ Hint: you can either nest the first check into the second, or use an & (AND) operator to combine them.

  If age is not 18+ or 21+, both access_event and access_music_show should stay FALSE and you should print "I guess I'll go somewhere else."
```{r}
# defining the variables
access_event <- FALSE
access_music_show <- FALSE
age <- 22
current_hour <- 9
possible_codeword <- "redrobbin"
real_codeword <- "bluejay"
# conditional code goes here:
if(age >= 21){
    access_event <- TRUE 
    print("I got in for the night!")
    if(possible_codeword == real_codeword){
      access_music_show <- TRUE
      print("I need to get a good spot!")
  }
}else if(age >= 18 & age < 21 & current_hour < 11){
  access_event <- TRUE
  print("I can stay until 11!")
}else{
  access_event <- FALSE
  access_music_show <- FALSE
  print("I guess I'll go somewhere else.")
}

```

Edit the code block to print the matrix elements column by column. First, run the code as is to see that it prints the elements of this matrix row-by-row. Notice how the row and col variables are increasing. Hint: you should make the outer loop iterate through the column indices, and the inner loop iterate through the row indices.
```{r}
# define the matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(c(12, 11, 24, 8, 2, 3, 9, 4, 12, 13, 25, 7, 23, 10, 19), nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
# modify the for statements:
for (col in 1:ncol(my_matrix)) {
    for (row in 1:nrow(my_matrix)) {
      print(paste("Row", row, "Column", col, ":", my_matrix[row, col]))
    }
}
```

The coin-flipping example is translated into code below. Read through the code thoroughly. In the while loop, we are printing the result at every flip so we can visualize each flip and see how many it takes until we reach our heads goal. Run the code several times to simulate different trials of coin-flipping.
```{r message=FALSE}
number_of_heads <- 0
heads_goal <- 2
coin <- c("heads", "tails")
while (number_of_heads < heads_goal) {
  # flip the coin (random)
  result <- sample(coin, 1)
  print(result)
  if (result == "heads") {
    number_of_heads <- number_of_heads + 1
  }
}
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a for loop to multiply all the numbers of a vector numbers together and keep the product in a variable called product, which we’ve set to 1 at the beginning. The product, which will be printed, should equal 81 at the end.
```{r}
numbers <- c(1.5, 3, 2, 4, 3, 0.25, 3)
product <- 1
# write loop code here:
for(x in numbers){
  product <- product * x
}
# print result
print(product)
```

Function that converts feed to meters 

```{r}
feet_to_meters <- function(feet) {
  meters <- feet * 0.3048
  return(meters)
}
feet_to_meters(30)
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an R function tolower() that takes in a string value and converts all the characters to lowercase. For example, tolower("OMG") would return "omg". In the workspace, we have a vector names that has names all in uppercase. Use an appropriate apply() function to create a list names_lower where all the names in names are now lowercase. Call names_lower so you can see it outputted.
```{r}
names <- c("ALEX","IAN","NATALIA", "CAROLYN")

# your code below
names_lower <- lapply(names, tolower)
names_lower
```
