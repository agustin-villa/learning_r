1.
In this exercise, you will use R to find the average age of the first four authors in Le Mondeâ€™s top 100 books.
29,49,42,4329,49,42,43
Add the values together, and set total equal to the answer. Print total.
2.
Divide total by the number of values in the dataset, and set mean_value to the answer.
Print mean_value. Keep that number in your head as you progress through the lesson.
---
```{r}
total <- 29 + 49 + 42 + 43
print(total)

mean_value <- total / 4
print(mean_value)
```

Finding mean without manually calculating
mean() will do the calculation for you
```{r}
example_data <- c(24, 16, 30, 10, 12, 28, 38, 2, 4, 36)

example_average <- mean(example_data)

print(example_average)
```

Finds the median of a data set: The middle of the dataset if there are 5 values
the median would be the value at index 3
```{r}
example_data2 = c(24, 16, 30, 10, 12, 28, 38, 2, 4, 36, 42)

example_median = median(example_data2)

print(example_median)
```

Finds the mode of the dataset: The value that appears the most in
the data set DescTools most be imported

If there are two modes a vector will be returned 
```{r}
library(DescTools)

example_data3 <- c(24, 16, 12, 10, 12, 28, 38, 12, 28, 24)

example_mode <- Mode(example_data3)
```
